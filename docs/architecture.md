# Architecture

I started from what a wigglegram actually needs and let each
requirement pick the hardware. This doc walks through that reasoning,
then covers the electronics, the data flow, and what I'd still like to
fix.

**1. Four views of the same instant.** If the four exposures are even a
few ms apart, anything moving (people, hair, leaves) ghosts between
frames and the 3-D illusion collapses. Software-triggering four
independent cameras (e.g. four ESP32-CAMs or four Pi cams on a mux that
*switches* between them) cannot achieve this. The Arducam Camarray HAT
clocks all four IMX519 sensors from one source and merges them into a
single 2×2-stitched frame. Because the sensors share that clock, the
exposures are simultaneous, and the Pi sees just one ordinary camera on
one CSI port.

**2. Parallax baseline.** The 3-D effect comes from the lenses being
horizontally offset. The enclosure spaces the four modules 40 mm apart
(120 mm outer baseline), close to the Nishika N8000 film camera that
inspired it. Frames are auto-aligned on the subject in software
(`wiggle.py`, phase correlation on a center crop) so the subject holds
still and the background does the wiggling.

**3. Handheld power.** The Pi 5 demands 5 V/5 A, beyond what generic power
banks and boost boards provide. The Geekworm X1202 (4×18650, BMS, 5.1 V/5 A) is
purpose-built for it and mounts under the Pi, keeping the top-side
camera/display connectors free.

**4. Instant sharing.** AirDrop is Apple-proprietary (AWDL) and not
implementable on a Pi. Instead the camera runs its own Wi-Fi hotspot
and a small Flask gallery (`share.py`); after each shot the touchscreen
shows a QR code that opens the GIF in any phone browser, iPhone or
Android, with no app to install.

## Firmware layout

| Module | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `config.py` | every tunable in one place |
| `camera.py` | Picamera2 setup, stitched capture, 2x2 split |
| `flash.py` | flash pulse control (v1 GPIO gate today; v2 I2C client planned) |
| `filters.py` | the filter looks (B&W, sepia, vivid, film), all pure functions |
| `wiggle.py` | subject alignment, bounce sequencing, GIF/JPEG export |
| `share.py` | hotspot gallery server + QR generation |
| `app.py` | Qt touch UI, buttons, capture orchestration |

## Known limitations / future work

- Quad synchronized mode caps each view at 2328×1748 (~4 MP). That's the
  price of single-cable hardware sync. It's enough for GIFs.
- GIF export ~2-4 s on the Pi 5; an MP4 export path would be smaller
  files and faster.
- Autofocus is per-kit (one focus setting for all four in sync mode);
  fixed-focus at ~1.5 m works well for the classic wigglegram portrait.
